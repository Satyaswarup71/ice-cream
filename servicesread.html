<h1 style= "font-size:50px; text-align:center;">About Us</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:30px; margin-bottom:50px;">At our core, we believe that business should be a force for good.<br> That’s why we are deeply committed to advancing racial equity, not only within our own workforce but also across the communities we serve.<br> For us, equity is not just a statement—it’s a responsibility and a guiding principle.<br>

<br>

We are working to build a culture where diversity is celebrated, inclusion is embraced, and opportunities are accessible to everyone.<br> Our goal is to create a workplace and franchise model that reflects the richness of the communities around us,<br> where people of all backgrounds can thrive, grow, and lead.<br>

<br>

In the past, we stood as a voice for social justice, and today, that commitment is stronger than ever.<br> We focus on real, measurable change that drives positive outcomes for people of color and ensures fairness at every level of our business.<br> Whether through hiring practices, supplier partnerships, or community engagement,<br> we are dedicated to breaking barriers and creating lasting impact.<br>

<br>

We believe equity is not a destination, but an ongoing journey.<br> It requires listening, learning, and holding ourselves accountable to do better every day.<br> Together, with our employees, partners, and customers,<br> we are shaping a future where opportunity is shared, justice is upheld, and every individual is respected and valued.<br>

<br>

Because when equity thrives, everyone thrives. ✨</p>
